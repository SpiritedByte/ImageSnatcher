# ImageSnatcher
Exploiting prnt.sc and its poor image hosting URLs.

# How it works?
Prnt.sc hosts images under a specific URL, generated from two letters followed by four numbers. For example:
```
https://prnt.sc/tr8749
```

# Why create this?
Users that use image hosting sites should be aware that their images are not private and can be potentially viewed by others. Please be aware that you should never upload sensitive information.
